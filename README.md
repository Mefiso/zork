# zork
Zork game to learn C++

## Introduction
Base code from [here](https://github.com/d0n3val/zork). The code was fixed for the game to behave as desired. 
Then, a bunch of features were added. For simplicity, the base code was maintained as much as possible and
most attributes are public (no getters and setters used). 

This is a Zork-like game. You will be a Hero that can move freely all over the "world" and interact with objects
and creatures. The world's "ticks" will advance every time a command is introduced (even if it is a not recognised command).
This means that if you are fighting a troll and cast a nonexistent spell the troll will attack you anyways, that is done to give a more realistic behaviour.
